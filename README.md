# ScholarBase
ScholarBase is a research project in progress that is aimed to serve as a Linked Data repository for cross-domain scholarly data. ScholarBase can be conceived as a knowledgebase that weaves links among scholars, institutions, research areas, publications, and geographical locations in a Linked Data fashion. Initially, the primary source of data stems from Google Scholar, specifically the profile pages of scholars. Subsequently, the collected dataset is transformed into a semantic-based format (i.e. RDF). The semantified dataset will enable a machine-readable expression of entity relationships, and can in turn be linked to external knowledge bases (e.g. DBpedia). ScholarBase is discussed in the paper below to be published within the International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2017):
